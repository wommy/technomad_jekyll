## a brief history

i started using jekyll in the summer of 2015 right after my father passed.

i was in chicago working for gerald at solution people that winter/spring. deciding to try a static site generator instead of wordpress vastly sped up my development: i got more done in three weeks than i did in three months.

previously i was using something called mixture, which mysteriously folded overnight, taking all the documentation with it. mixture gave me a gui so i didnt have to use the command line. but that summer at original graphics printing, i reached out to jekyll, primarily, in hindsight, because of my familiarity with ruby.

## technomad: blog publishing software

this site serves as technomad's development documentation. 

each post i write here will serve to document the various steps i took in the software development process.
sooner or later, ill strip down jekyll and explain how everything works.

my first few posts are going to follow along as i rebuild wommy.io, the first technomad site.
